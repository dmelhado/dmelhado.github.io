Background I started using computers when I was around 3, back when they were pretty uncommon where I live, mostly to play old arcade videogames. By 10, I was already messing with hardware and software. I broke a lot of perfectly good setups doing this. At 19, I began a Computer Science degree at UBA, which I left after four years. I’m currently studying Computer Systems at UNGS. I worked at an RPA consulting firm for two years but was let go due to staff cuts. Since then I explored other skills, including electronic repairs and web development (which led to this site). Most of them self taught. Today I juggle freelance phone and computer repairs and food delivery. It’s not glamorous, but it pays the bills.
