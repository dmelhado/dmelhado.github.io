Background I started using computers when I was around 3, back when they were pretty uncommon where I live, mostly to play old arcade videogames. By 10, I was already messing with hardware and software. I broke a lot of perfectly good setups doing this. I still needlessly break stuff to this day. At 19, I began studying Computer Science at UBA. After four years, I switched to Computer Systems at UNGS, where I’m still learning. I worked at an RPA consulting firm for two years but was let go due to staff cuts. Since then I explored other skills, including electronic repairs and web development. Most of them self-taught. Today, I split my time between maintaining computers at a rural public school, helping out with tech and teaching at other schools, and doing occasional freelance phone and computer repairs for friends and neighbors.
