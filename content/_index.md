Personal website where I'll post some of my thoughts, experiments, failures, and everything in between. I hope you can find something useful for your project here. If you want to send me a question, suggestion, greeting or death threat, you can reach me at dmelhado@dc.uba.ar.

## Background
- I started using computers when I was around 3, back when they were pretty uncommon where I live, mostly to play old arcade videogames.
- By 10, I was already messing with hardware and software. I broke a lot of perfectly good setups doing this.
- At 19, I began a Computer Science degree at UBA, which I left after four years. I'm currently studying Computer Systems at UNGS.
- I worked at an RPA consulting firm for two years but was let go due to staff cuts.
- Since then I explored other skills, including electronic repairs and web development (which led to this site). Most of them self taught.
- Today I juggle freelance phone and computer repairs and food delivery. It's not glamorous, but it pays the bills. 

## Some of my interests
- FOSS software
- 3D Modeling and computer graphics
- Game development
- Electronics
- Math and statistics
