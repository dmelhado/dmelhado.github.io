Personal website where I'll post some of my thoughts, experiments, failures, and everything in between. I hope you can find something useful for your project here. If you want to send me a question, suggestion, greeting or death threat, you can reach me at dmelhado@dc.uba.ar.

## Background
- I started using computers when I was around 3, back when they were pretty uncommon where I live, mostly to play old arcade videogames.
- By 10, I was already messing with hardware and software. I broke a lot of perfectly good setups doing this. I still needlessly break stuff to this day.
- At 19, I began studying Computer Science at UBA. After four years, I switched to Computer Systems at UNGS, where I’m still learning.
- I worked at an RPA consulting firm for two years but was let go due to staff cuts.
- Since then I explored other skills, including electronic repairs and web development. Most of them self-taught.
- Today, I split my time between maintaining computers at a rural public school, helping out with tech and teaching at other schools, and doing occasional freelance phone and computer repairs for friends and neighbors.
